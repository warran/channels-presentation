# Django Channels presentation code

This repository contains code and presentation slides for a speech
on [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
prepared for Python Community of [SoftServe](https://softserve.ua/pl/)

The code was written for presentational purposes only and is very rough,
so don't blame me if not everything is state-of-the-art ;) (probably 
nothing is :P )

To learn where are the channels-related parts of code located, check 
README in the _code_ directory.

_presentation_ contains onlt the LaTeX code of the presentation slides,
so nothing interesting there, but if you really want to compile it,
just remember to use Beamer.
